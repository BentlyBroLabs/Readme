### BentlyBroLabs

**Innovate. Collaborate. Secure.**

Welcome to BentlyBroLabs, where we are dedicated to pioneering open-source, DIY projects that empower individuals and communities. Our mission is to create user-centric products and systems that prioritize privacy and security.

**What We Do:**

- **Open-Source Projects**: We develop and share a wide range of open-source projects, from hardware prototypes to software applications, all designed for easy replication and modification.
- **DIY Solutions**: Our projects encourage hands-on engagement, allowing you to build, customize, and improve upon our designs.
- **Community Driven**: We believe in the power of community. Our projects are driven by collaboration and contributions from users like you.
- **Privacy Focused**: Your privacy is our priority. We integrate robust security features into our projects to ensure your data remains protected. Whenever possible, we design our products to work with local hosting, giving you complete control over your data.

Join us on our journey to create innovative, secure, and community-driven solutions. Together, we can build a future where technology works for everyone, safeguarding privacy and promoting creativity.

I host my own [Code Block](https://cb.bentlybro.com/BentlyBroLabs) which will also contain everything I share here.
